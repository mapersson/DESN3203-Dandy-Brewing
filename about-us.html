            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The Dandy Brewing Company is Calgary's original small brewery. Although it has grown a little, it's still
                small at heart. We produce inspired ales, with lots of care, in small batches.</p>
            <p>Our unique approach to brewing and keen eye to every detail and fosters creativity in both our recipes
                and beer styles.</p>
            <p>On site, we are pleased to offer a unique brewery experience, featuring a full service tasting room with
                an exquisite menu of fine dining drinking food, a curated selection of cocktails, glass pours of
                selected wines, and 20 taps of Dandy beers.</p>
            <p>We share a passion for not only brewing, but the people, process, experiences, and personal touches that
                make the real ale experience so special.</p>
