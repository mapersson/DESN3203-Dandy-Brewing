            <h3>Dandy in the Underwood</h3>
            <p>5.5% ABV</p>
            <p>The main Dandy. This beer is our most popular offering and available everywhere, all the time. A light
                body with notes of coffee, chocolate, and light roast, this traditional Oyster Stout is sure to be a
                favourite.</p>
            <p>Pairs well with oysters, fish, and other salty snacks!</p>

            <h3>Une Vielle Maitresse</h3>
            <p>4.5% ABV</p>
            <p>This farmhouse ale is available year round in the bottle and draught. A table strength beer brewed with
                rye and french saison yeast. It is light, refreshing, with a touch of spice and saison character. Brewed
                once as a limited edition, we can't seem to shake this old mistress.</p>

            <h3>The Dandy Wild Sour Ale</h3>
            <p>7.3%</p>
            <p>A bold, malty sour ale soured with lactobacillus and fermented with a wild yeast strain. An upfront
                sourness is balanced with wild yeast character for a rich sour experience.</p>

            <h3>The Golden Brown Dandy</h3>
            <p>6% ABV</p>
            <p>Our English Pale ale. This beer is a low-carbonation ode to real-ale. A smooth malt body is balanced with
                a highly intensive hops schedule to bring forward a great tasting beer to reward all ale lovers!
                Available only in bottles and casks.</p>
            <p>Pairs well with meats, rich sauces and hard, aged cheeses</p>

            <h2>Seasonal Releases</h2>

            <h3>Baltus van Tassel: Cherry Sour</h3>
            <p>7% ABV</p>
            <p>Fall</p>
            <p>An American Style Cherry Sour. A rich brown American Brown sour brewed with Sweet and Tart cherries for
                the perfect accompaniment to shorter days and colder weather.</p>

            <h3>In the Bleak Midwinter: Black IPA</h3>
            <p>6.5% ABV</p>
            <p>Winter</p>
            <p>A fruity Black IPA. With only a kiss of roast, this black IPA is fresh and juicy but dark as the coldest
                days of winter. Citra and Mosaic are late hop additions to avoid the bitterness and focus on aroma.</p>

            <h3>The Jungle Bird: Tropical Dark Sour</h3>
            <p>5% ABV</p>
            <p>Spring</p>
            <p>An homage to the classic Tiki cocktail. This beer has notes of demerara sugar, bitter lime, tropical
                pineapple coming together for a refreshing sour that is like no other.</p>

            <h3>Bright Young Things: Hopped Wheat Ale</h3>
            <p>5.5% ABV</p>
            <p>Summer</p>
            <p>English Summer Ale. A style developed during a late 70’s heat wave in England, this beer is designed to
                refresh in the hot summer sun. Dry, with a touch of wheat and toasted Victory malt, it is balanced with
                a touch of bitterness and a sweet citrus aroma. Patios, BBQ’s, and friends all pair perfectly with this
                beer!</p>
